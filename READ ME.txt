I whipped up a cute little form we are going to use through out the tutorials.
Keep the following in  mind:

~When it comes to html and CSS, its a good idea to make a global CSS file which you can use throughout your system.
~The naming of your input files is very important so you don't have to confuse your values,try to be as descriptive as you can in terms of naming your input fields.
~Always add comments on your code!!!.
TIPS:
1. a little tip is,if you are not given the names or id's of your input fields, name them the same way as you named the fields in the database, makes it easier when saving the information to the database and you don't have to refer to both the file and the table fields name.
2. a great application to use is eclipse because you dont have to run your web page first to see if there are errors, and its easier to adjust to the syntax.
